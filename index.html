     <p id="idname1">The dog <b>(Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)</b> is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of Pleistocene wolves <u>are</u>  10,000 years ago. The dog was the <i>sjd</i> species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of agriculture.
